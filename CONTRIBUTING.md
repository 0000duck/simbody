## Contributor License Agreement

Simbody is an open source project licensed under extremely flexible terms intended to encourage use by *anyone*, for *any purpose*. Simbody users are not forced to acknowledge us, or subscribe to our egalitarian principles, or share their vast profits with us. This is a community effort and we want your contributions, but only under equally flexible terms so that Simbody remains wide open for everyone.

When you make a contribution to the Simbody project, you are agreeing to the following terms:

1. The code or text you submit is your original work (you own and retain the copyright) or you otherwise have the right to submit the work.
2. You grant the Simbody project, developers, and users a nonexclusive, irrevocable license to use in any way your submission and any necessary intellectual property.
3. No part of your contribution is covered by a viral license like GPL or LGPL.
4. You are capable of granting these rights for the contribution.
