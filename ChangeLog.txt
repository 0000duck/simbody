            Changes made in experimental branch 
      since split from Simbody 2.3 trunk on 8/16/2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
8/16 Version changed to 3.0
8/16 Checked in FrictionConstraints doc
8/21 Rearchitected constraint API to support use of constraints
     as operators (BREAKING CHANGE TO CUSTOM CONSTRAINTS)
8/25 Fixed bug 1521 in SpeedCoupler constraint; backported to 2.3.
8/29 Fixed bug 1522 in memory-sharing Vector constructor; backported to 2.3.
8/29 Added calcBodyAccelerationFromUDot() method to matter subsystem.
8/29 Renamed getCoriolisAcceleration() to getMobilizerCoriolisAcceleration()
     and getCentrifugalForces() to getMobilizerCentrifugalForces()
     to make it clear that these are just mobilizer-incremental contributions.
     This is a BREAKING CHANGE if anyone ever called those, but probably if
     they did it was a mistake and they should have been calling 
     getTotalCoriolisAccleration() or getTotalCentrifugalForces() which are
     the meaningful physical quantities.
